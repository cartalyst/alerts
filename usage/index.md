## Usage

In this section we'll show how you can make us of the alerts package.

### Alert Types

Types can be decided by the user, the type is defined by the method name you call on the facade.

`error` type

```php
Alert::error('error message');
```

`warning` type

```php
Alert::warning('warning message');
```

`foo` type

```php
Alert::foo('foo message');
```

### Notifiers

Notifiers are responsible for storing the alerts across your application.

Alerts ships with two notifiers.

#### Default

The default notifier is used without having to call an additional method that returns the desired notifier.

- Laravel

The default notifier is set to `flash`.

- Native

The default notifier can be set using `Alert::setDefaultNotifier($notifier)`

#### Retrieve a notifier

Sending alerts using a different notifier requires retrieving the notifier first.

##### Usage

Assuming we have a `view` notifier we can the following.

```php
// Call the notifier `key` on the facade to retrieve the notifier.
Alert::view()->error('foo');

// Call the `notifier` method and pass in the notifier key.
Alert::notifier('view')->error('foo');
```

#### Flash Notifier (notifies on redirections)

The flash notifier requires `illuminate/session` and `illuminate/filesystem` in order to add flashing notifications capability.

The flash notifier will persist the alert for one request.

##### Usage

```php
Alert::error('Error message');
```

> **Note** The flash notifier is the default notifier, therefore, all alerts that are directly called on the facade will be handled by the flash notifier.

#### Notifier (notifies on the same request)

The notifier will persist the alerts during the current request only.

##### Usage

```php
Alert::view()->error('Error message');
```

#### Alert Areas

In addition to a message, the various notifiers accept an optional second argument, which is an area name. Areas are useful for displaying messages in specific places within the rendered response output.

When an area is not specfied, the `detault` area is used, which may not be ideal in all scenarios.

For example, your layout might normally output alerts at the top of the page, but perhaps you would like to display alerts that are specific to a particular area of the layout in context, and not at the top of the page.

You can achieve this by specifying an area:

```php
Alert::error('Error message', 'right-sidebar');
```

Now, this error message will be returned only when you retrieve alerts that include the `right-sidebar` area, as explained below.

### Retrieving alerts

The methods below will apply the desired filters to the list of alerts, afterwards, `get` can be called in order to retrieve the alerts.

The methods below can be chained to filter down alerts more than once.

```php
Alert::whereType('foo')->whereArea('bar')->get();
```

#### Alert::whereType($type|$types)

This method will filter down alerts based on the given type(s).

##### Usage

```php
// Returns all alerts of type `foo`
Alert::whereType('foo')->get();

// Returns all alerts of type `foo` and `bar`
Alert::whereType([ 'foo', 'bar' ])->get();
```

#### Alert::whereArea($area|$areas)

This method will filter down alerts based on the given area(s).

##### Usage

```php
// Returns all alerts of area `foo`
Alert::whereArea('foo')->get();

// Returns all alerts of area `foo` and `bar`
Alert::whereArea([ 'foo', 'bar' ])->get();
```

#### Alert::whereNotType($type|$types)

This method will filter down alerts excluding the given type(s).

##### Usage

```php
// Returns all alerts excluding type `foo`
Alert::whereNotType('foo')->get();

// Returns all alerts excluding type `foo` and `bar`
Alert::whereNotType([ 'foo', 'bar' ])->get();
```

#### Alert::whereNotArea($type|$types)

This method will filter down alerts excluding the given area(s).

##### Usage

```php
// Returns all alerts excluding area `foo`
Alert::whereNotArea('foo')->get();

// Returns all alerts excluding area `foo` and `bar`
Alert::whereNotArea([ 'foo', 'bar' ])->get();
```

#### Alert::get()

You can retrieve all or the filtered list of alerts using the `get` method. Calling this method will return a list of alerts and reset any applied filters afterwards.

```php
// All alerts
$alerts = Alert::get();
```

### Generating the alerts view

```php
@foreach (Alert::get() as $alert)

<div class="alert">

	<p>{{ $alert->message }}</p>

</div>

@endforeach
```

> **Note** The example above uses Laravel's blade syntax for readability.

#### Class

Alert classes can be useful when it comes to adding classes to HTML elements, let's take an `error` alert as an example.

The `class` property on every alert defaults to the alert type, in our case `error`.

##### Alert

```php
Alert::error('Error');
```

##### View

The following view will output the class `alert-error` on the `div` tag.

```
@foreach (Alert::get() as $alert)

<div class="alert alert-{{ $alert->class }}">

	<p>{{ $alert->message }}</p>

</div>

@endforeach
```

Changing that class to `alert-danger` can be achieved by:


- Native

Calling the setConfig method on the `AlertsBootstrapper` and passing in the $config array.

```php
$config = [

	'error' => 'danger',

];

Cartalyst\Alerts\Native\AlertsBootstrapper::setConfig($config);
```

- Laravel

Updating the config file and providing a key/value array that defines the classes to rewrite.

```php
return [

	'error' => 'danger',

];
```
